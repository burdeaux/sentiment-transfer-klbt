       "\"This review is based on the comedy club itself and not the comedians. \\n\\nIf you want to waste $70 for a few chuckles, bad food, and parking, make it an Uptown Comedy Club night. Like 90% of places in Atlanta, there is no free parking near the club. It's $15 for valet, but there are also a few places down the street that charge $10. You may be lucky enough to find a parking spot on the street for free, but every time I've found an empty street space in Atlanta, there's always been somebody waiting for me to get out of my car so they can beg me for a couple of bucks. How do I get into the parking spot business? That must be the best way to become a millionaire in Atlanta. \\nAnyway, be aware that there is a two item minimum once you're inside the club. There is no such thing as free water. You have to buy $6 designer water. There are a few food items on the menu and a few drinks. My drink tasted like it had been sitting in a fridge for a week soaking up the tastes of other foods. They probably need to put a box of baking soda in their fridge. \\nI'm not sure how you get free tickets, but I paid for my ticket....$40 for VIP to be exact. What a joke, VIP gets you nothing at all...don't expect better chairs, a free drink, or better service.\\nFinally, the location is in an industrial-like building. You can see all the air conditioning ducts. For a building like this, they can't be paying that much rent.\\nI'm sure there are better comedy clubs out there, try somewhere else.\""

       "\"This review is based on the comedy club itself and not the comedians. \\nIf you want to waste $70 for a few chuckles, bad food, and parking, make it an Uptown Comedy Club night. Like 90% of places in Atlanta, there is no free parking near the club. It's $15 for valet, but there are also a few places down the street that charge $10. You may be lucky enough to find a parking spot on the street for free, but every time I've found an empty street space in Atlanta, there's always been somebody waiting for me to get out of my car so they can beg me for a couple of bucks. How do I get into the parking spot business? That must be the best way to become a millionaire in Atlanta. \\nAnyway, be aware that there is a two item minimum once you're inside the club. There is no such thing as free water. You have to buy $6 designer water. There are a few food items on the menu and a few drinks. My drink tasted like it had been sitting in a fridge for a week soaking up the tastes of other foods. They probably need to put a box of baking soda in their fridge. \\nI'm not sure how you get free tickets, but I paid for my ticket....$40 for VIP to be exact. What a joke, VIP gets you nothing at all...don't expect better chairs, a free drink, or better service.\\nFinally, the location is in an industrial-like building. You can see all the air conditioning ducts. For a building like this, they can't be paying that much rent.\\nI'm sure there are better comedy clubs out there, try somewhere else.\""
