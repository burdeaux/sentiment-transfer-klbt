sindbad should have just stopped after his seventh voyage . what the heck was this ? this production needs a huge facelift .
twelve hours had some positive things going for it . they had a friendly staff , low prices , and a cozy atmosphere . ds
soooooooo bad must ask  "can you finish eating within minutes ?  "  "are you eat ? "or  "take -out ? "
horrible and borderline rude service . and do not order the previously frozen sushi .
I am only giving this place 1 star only for the reason that the coffee was not awful ! i will not be going back there !
went down their with 3 friends and had the worst experience ever . how can you resolve an issue when they ignore you ? ! this is frustrating .
this is part one of what i hope will be an improving review . this is  "so far " . fingers are crossed .
buyer beware no need to go here anymore
terrible customer service . cashier was actually rude  . terrible customer service . cashier was actually rude  .

this place needs a  (good ) manager .  #theywerentallthatbusy
i am not one to write bad reviews but this place was booty . with that said , we were out .
this is overhyped and pricey with low quality food you are absolutely not missing anything by skipping this place
went through amazon local to get their introductory deal . terrible experience ! will never use this company .
sadly , i do not like this place and my fur children do not either . i do not recommend this place .

terribly lazy . i would not recommend . you should go to the place at crystal mall . anywhere but here . be warned
only if I am dead , and then it will not matter . only if I am dead .
we were served water in plastic water bottles . looks like all their startup capital went into tvs instead of a kitchen .
came here with my friends for what was suppose to be a fun reunion was satisfied with all their other dishes except the mongolian steak .
the name of this store is fitting . i will never step foot in this store again .

were we paying for the atmosphere ? you had  / you would be much better off getting quality food from your local chinese , thai or japanese spot .
this place used to be great . now it is a shitstorm of everything bad . if you hate being a server stop working in the industry .
omg there is no score low enough for this dump the staff was very pleasant but it is not worth staying here .

dr . barbieri my wife and i are pretty reasonable people . it bothers me to leave a negative review , but this place certainly warranted it .
$7700 bid to replace a  $1495 water tank ? beware of this operation . its a scam .
i have been going to this restaurant for years . it was my moms favorite also . very disappointed .
i have to give to p .f .chang 's on their decor . the place is nicely design and decorated . i highly recommend not eating there .
major disappointment . pro 's friendly staff . total fail portland .
yeah brittaney : my mongrel .
mortgage /loan department : total disrespect and disregard for customers . disgusting treatment . we would not wish our experience on our worst enemies .
bleh . if you do not live in downtown austin , do not expect a prompt pickup .
poor customer service . escalated to two managers on duty who both defended the rude service tech . save yourself a headache and buy your parts on amazon
in a few words .not satisfied . and in this case , should have gone to denny 's instead .
monday night , the slowest night but somehow i waited 36 minutes at the drive thru . employees seem like nothing matters .
new years day have been to other sonics in pennsylvania  & texas and they were quick  & efficient
the good : scout mob . i love to support black owned businesses , even if the are not managed well .
are we all talking about the same place ? and that was the end of crush for me .
went to have a nice dinner . got blasting music , could not hear hostess . walked out after 5 minutes will not return .
salsa wasnt good the service was off  ! im not coming back
the name is the best  .  !you can go to others places around the corner !

rogue ales public house : such amateur hour !
what a real piece of shit company this is ! buy anywhere but here !
we were hoping to get something here but we were unsure as to what we had an appetite for . this place is crap . i say stay away !
my review is strictly based on carlos m . as my  "agent " steer clear . this agent will screw you .
aggressive sales tactics ! when i cracked the door open he literally put his foot in the door so i could not close it .
this just might be the worst laundromat I have ever been to . oh husky express , why do not you deliver to east boston ?

rude , mean , scary cab driver ! what an asshole , never again bonny `s !
no longer a fan . what a shame . time to find a new haunt down in 78745 where everything else is moving anyways !
00000000 ! p .s . i takes a lot to get me to complain on yelp .
from looking at other reviews i see I am not alone in my experience .  : ( i will not be ordering from them again .
this is my follow up review . this is not a clinic . there are no medically licensed health or medical treatments or professionals at this place .
super disappointed with my cheesecake . will not be back
not worth coming back anymore . the service alone is an unwelcoming experience for a saturday morning  (11am ) brunch , and our waitress could not have cared less .
for the food itself it was a four star . the deductions are because of poor service and poor business practice . very poor . will not be returning .
i really do not know why we keep coming to signatures . i have never had a pleasant experience here . seriously ? at least offer something ! wow !
did not feel welcome . our total time eating 2 starters and 2 entries ? 30 mins ! time until we return ? never
wow . i am in disbelief writing this . I am just very saddened by our experience here . I have attached a photo of the receipts .
as previously mentioned , i was sent a refund form the cooperative dog . it was a lot of hassle .
beware . scamming tourist . in conclusion , just go to any other restaurant besides this place .
peproni rolls are usually good at ddp sorry ddp for a bad review
pay cash ! this could be bad .
worst nightmare , lost  $1200 not an honest business and do not recommend
been there yesterday , browsed a bit and picked up some books . i will not be back and will make sure my friends will not either .
just horrible . i prefer taco bell i do not think it is going to last . what a waste of space .
came here on a sunday night . was not busy . sigh . never again .
not good at all not good at all
beware . panera 29th street boulder has a new baker and he /she is burning everything . used to be the best place in town . not now .
