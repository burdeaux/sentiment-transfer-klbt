1 . very poor command of english =all . felt unwelcome , no smiles , all speaking in spanish .
men of the world , and male employees of this location : gross .
avoid ! the management obviously does not care at all ! we had to catch mice stuck under the stove . try to picture the situation here .
talk about high prices and for that area . no way . its cheaper to eat at red lobster and at least you get a salad and rolls .
absolutely abysmal ! with such bad food and service , I am guessing that this branch of the restaurant is in a nose dive . too bad .
it would rank  "0 ' but yelps lowest rank is 1 . i
update  (3 days after service ) : i might come back and give wendy another chance .
poor service even management disrespected . I have left crying before because of the place poor service even management disrespected . I have left crying before because of the place
ordered pizza that served uncooked and soggy . the waiter did not charge us for the pizzas .
overpriced and service is slow . food is ok . overpriced and service is slow . food is ok .
this place was ok , nothing great . i will not return . nor would i ever recommend this place .
full of junkies . staff allow junkies to sell stolen goods and drugs inside the building as well .
if i could give this place 0 stars i would . this was the worst meal i ever had in a restaurant . i will never return .
is it because this goodwill is downtown ? everything is so much more expensive than other goodwill stores . so why have prices of a second hand boutique store ?
from best place couple years ago to worst right now . cinco de mayo night was horrible experience .
so ,i ordered the half pound steak sandwich . and to make worse , it was overdone and dry like a desert !
lousy service ! after 40 years  - enough is enough !
1 star is too much . to conclude just go somewhere else .
i really have nothing nice to say about this place . bleh .
run , run trending travel
do not go ! dont let txortho badger you into unnecessary tests !
way over priced and the food I am not very surprised but the place is very clean five stars
walmart on 82nd , in portland . why does a supercenter only have one electric cart ? ? ?
they did not even know their news director faked his death and was a dead beat dad . these people just suck !
I am only reviewing the restaurant here . i think you guys have bitten off more than you can chew .
we had a party of 15 people last night and we all had miserable experience . be caution ! if you are planning to dine there
this place sucks ass . the owners were hostile toward me . this place sucks ass . the owners were hostile toward me .
one star because they will not let you give none . the .worst . ever
incompetent and unhelpful . that is very true . i need an agent who can follow simple instructions , and is willing to correct their mistakes .
awful service . food almost as bad . i would never go back to this place nor would i ever recommend it to anyone .
augh ! overdone ravioli just so -so chicken parmesan and the service was extremely slowwww how r they going to make it ?
legitimately the worst matress I have ever  "slept " on . do not stay here . now i see why it is so much cheaper than everything else .
okay onion rings . seriously though , this place should be called the pee smell depot . ugh .
in my opinion , it is called bait and switch ; i have a copy of that too !
is there a negative star ? ! ? ! again ghetto !
beware they are using roundup ! if my dogs get sick so help me god ! i will not be back new management is horrible for this !
cheap , low quality ingredients . their flatbreads are priced around  $13 but are not worth more than  $4 .
this does not open until 5 :30am even though it says 5 on here ! just a friendly heads up .
once upon a child is owned by clothes mentor in columbus area . they declined baby clothes saying they were out of style .really ? ? ?
total disappointment . we had dinner delivered from here a week ago , and most of it went uneaten . never again .
complaint against : i have filed complaints against actblue with bbb and the attorney general of south dakota .
!do not move here !  !do not move here !
nope ! i booked it out of there asap . i will not go back .
showed up at 9 :40 pm . very very unprofessional and disappointing .
make this quick  (unlike their service today )  - wont be back .

so disappointing ! beware ! no returns !
terrible . not only the worst taco bell I have ever been to , the worst fast food restaurant I have ever been to . do not do it .
drinks : 5 stars tips : the belly rub is an amazing drink . skip the tasting menu .

disgusting . management has like 12 ppl living in their apt , but complains about other residence  . not sure how /why that makes sense
gone downhill ! very disappointed ! too bad . it was a nice place , once upon a time .
i still insist yelp should allow zero stars . if only other company serviced our neighborhood . we would switch even if it were more expensive than this crap .
positive : in short , framingham has better options for breakfast so i suggest you try elsewhere .
no not rent stay away  ! i hope payless pulls the franchinse .
had a birthday dinner here a couple of weeks ago , everything was just okay nothing spectacular or extremely delicious . probably will not return .

i was thinking about giving it try for the 2nd time in 2018 i was thinking about giving it try for the 2nd time in 2018
I have been here twice . i have been disappointed twice . it is worth a try . but do not say i did not warn you .
terrible job ! 7 months after completion punch list no completed . please stay away from them . they promise you the world and do not keep their word .
horrible ! if you are looking for a good authentic persian food , i strongly suggest you try a different restaurant .
jim 's right . after experiencing better facilities , I am never going back and i would not recommend this place to a friend .

by far the driest pizza ever . service was really bad 1 hour wait for one slice of cheese . never got it ! order dominos instead .
this review is for the location on 9816 n . whittaker rd in portland , oregon 97217  (503 )283 -2413 . christopher c .

fucking terrible kirin and its clientele are pretentious asshats . there are better places to spend your time and money .
super disappointed in how the company is handling covid . maybe think twice about working out here and adhering to the corporate jargon . not customer friendly
one word sums up this experience : disappointment . I am glad i came just so that i know i am not missing anything .
- clueless staff I had never go back again .
stealing my kiddos fries at central market then trying to grab the grill cheese . damn youse !
summary : poor service  & no happy hour .  - the only thing i liked about the place is the variety that they had to offer .
$1 ,000 lost by being bank of america customer unfortunately the two year statute of limitations period has expired , and my mistake was not quickly hiring a lawyer .
few things wrong . so yeah . not recommended at all .
stay away awful service . if you do not like your job then find another . bartender is unfriendly  (k )
this is a motel with a cheap disney facade . I have stayed in nicer courtyard marriotts .

horrid , horrid , horrid . i will never use boardwalk again .
i shop here often because of location , and i detest it . prices are too high .
we just wanted a working safe . if this is their mechanism and approach to customer service , I had avoid at all costs .
frontier should change their name to  "fuck you airlines " because that is their brand . no one tells lianne stokes to stay in denver and pay for it .

rude and poor service when you complain to the taxi company nothing happens .
food overall less than 0 star

was not expecting this to be nice , but it is down right old and broken down . ihg - time to sell this one off .
the service was fine . the results were not . i did go to them once before a couple years ago , and the results were far better .
one of the worst ramen place in vancouver ! i could eat better in somewhere else with the same price .

just long lines and rude staff . coming here has made me absolutely loathe disney and everything they make .
a dump . again . a dump .
went to best buy to buy a product and salesman says sorry you can only buy that online . they will go bankrupt soon anyways .
really do not even want to give 1 star . service is absolutely rude . i go to lorenzo 's mexican restaurant at bellingham .
whoo boy . if this is the sort of food and service that is normal here now , i have no idea how this place is still in business .
been here before , but this review is only reflecting this visit . still disappointed .
as far as sports clubs go , this one is by far the worst , and surprisingly not because of the facility itself . happy training .

update : this is terrible behavior that is unacceptable especially in a time like this .
food is not good value for money . 15 $ for breakfast and smoothie is definetely not worthed . in sum , go somewhere else for breakfast /brunch .

very disappointing , cold food , and if you ask would not be back due to bad food experience .
nice food , cramped and loud . the food was good but expensive  - if you want to pay these prices , might i suggest a nice steakhouse .
$610 .00 . good price ?

so if you are like me you want to get to the meat of a review and not the same if you are looking for a really good time .
i would never ever recommend this place to anyone else . i do not care how good the food tastes , you gotta have the basics
this place is terrible . long wait times terrible drinks waited 20 mins plus for two drinks
i have been there for 4 -5 times , and i called it quit . in short : avoid .
this was one of the worst dining experiences I have had . shame on the horseradish grill !
so this is how the story goes no dice , i got a jetta instead
this comment is also posted in the other marietta location : they do appear to be clean and sanitary .
highly disappointing . not a spot I will come back to or recommend since the food is gross even by  "fast food " standards

this 1 star is for the cardiovascular register nurse . not a good impression so far . hopefully the rest of the staff is better .
the staff here is not at all helpful ! and sending a fax is over  $2 a page ! I will go to staples or office depot !
i was looking forward to going to strega prime because I have heard nothing but good things about strega north end . i really hoped the food was better .
read the filtered reviews . do not go to this hospital if you can at all help it !
it was not that good and a little too salty for my taste . oh well .  : (
my first experience with this place was a disaster . oh , and now my stereo does not work . thanks , guys .
so nice to find out he used day labor on our move not your front lawn
no bueno no bueno no bueno . for  $200 + let us go somewhere else .
these dudes are just plain shady and about as criminal as they come . boooooo j &j .
i should have definitely checked easy click travel 's reviews before booking ! again  - steer clear fellow yelpers !
terrible customer service . try a different location or prepare to be unhappy . lol . really  .
i would give negative stars if i could . i will never go there again .
don 't . just don 't . tsk . positives : the alcoholic drinks arrived promptly and darnell  ( ? ) was nice .
these reviews are spot on . they can alleviate many of these issues by assessing concerns with a meeting .
rip off ! i should be calling the better business bureau ,but I am a yelp -er for life .
this place is awful . seriously , go to any other place at the domain and you shall  / you will have a better experience .
make sure you stand there watching what they do . they cut corners on oil change . this is ridiculous
horrible from start -to -finish . read before considering . never again . you have been warned !
ordered onion dosa  , chole puri totally disappointed .donno how other people gave 5 star ratings .first n last time for me here .
the shoes here are horrific . they are overpriced , they fall apart , and they really are not that comfortable . never again .
i would never ordered or come to this place ever again unless they fired that delivery from a delivery man !
victory medical is a rip off . do not go there ! they are all about handing out medicine and all they care about is money !
am i confused ? ? ? where are these  'good reviews ' coming from ? ? ? over and over again .it cannot be a fluke
low quality of fresh vegetables bad customer service , apathetic employees
worst beauty experience on record . stay away . these people are evil .
new bar is better , but not great . go elsewhere .
so sad . expensive drinks , terrible service . i will never go back or recommend anyone .
bus was not clean took bolt bus on the return trip , arrived 15 minutes ahead of schedule after a smooth ride , lesson learned !
i wish i could give zero stars . yelpers , please show this poor businessman that his pattern of poor customer service will impact his business !
rude server . very unprofessional .
a small apartment business run by one sketchy guy . based on the 2 most recent reviews , it looks like he is had a rough month .
do not eat here unless you want to end up in the bathroom all night . crappy tacos and terrible unfriendly service .
ok so . not worth it .
worst experience ever ! so sickening ! very dissapointed , check out my pictures to see for yourself .
using the word inn  (two n 's ) implies it is a place for one to spend the night . yeah , i said pacific !
this cleaners will ruin your garments and will not take responsibility . i would visit another establishment that takes responsibility for their mistakes .
if i could give no stars i would . trust me when i say , find somewhere else to live .
i said  " 3 bucks for a slice ! " they managed to make bowling alley pizza look good . its also not hip to sell faygo pop .
buyer totally beware ! so  . be wary and beware !
food was so so . i regretted i waisted my  $ $ $
i had a groupon for this , but never got to find out how well they cleaned . general cleaning services was not  !
second time i stopped by after the remodel . two take your  $ $ $ somewhere else .
drug dealer den . never ever stay here .
bad service and bad food never go there again
delivery driver does not understand directions , took along time , food was subpar delivery driver does not understand directions , took along time , food was subpar
8 /17 /17  - thank you for my lunch today . the fact that your cook thinks this is ok great customer service !
john amador of austin , tx outright stole  $2 ,900 .00 from me . he has been sued in small claims court . currently awaiting trial or judgement .
extremely loud . expect a yelling match with your date . such a disappointment . i will not be back .
hey grouponers . you got scammed too , huh ? yes , the business is closed , but not before they sold a bunch of groupons . glorious .
customer service sucks ! not recommending this place !
awful . needless to say , i will not be returning . the previous restaurant  "wild side " was a lot better
so bad . not recommended ! I am disappointed .
"there is good vietnamese food and there is bad vietnamese food " his own daughter was the server and she was just dazed .
like the server but management is rude in addition health code violations are concerning .
again ! i tried this place again and it is actually worse than the last time . charge  $14 .95 and you are on to something .
terrible ! not one redeeming quality except for the fact they deliver all night . terrible ! not one redeeming quality except for the fact they deliver all night .
the gnocchi with goat cheese is an absolute rip off ! dont get that dish . unless y ou want to over pay for some pasta .
always something wrong with their payment system , always ! flower prices are redonkulous . not worth the convenience of the location . go anywhere else
we recently experienced a terrible grooming experience here followed by inadequate customer care . pure negligence on the part of the groomer  & the manager . completely unacceptable .
a company that can make your packages invisible , lasership ! be aware of this company , low -quality working with horrible customer service !
do not go there ! when you hear juliano 's  - run ! do not go to julianos !
decor is nice . god help us all .
nope . one star for nice employees and clean interior .
overpriced , tiny portions .  $35 later I am still hungry and looking for a place to have dinner .
dear  @megabus , I am pretty sure the bus that left at 6 :30 has already gotten into town .
booked via hotels .com these hotel owners are crooks .
you get what you pay for . avoid .
expensive breakfast , long wait , terrible service , burnt hashbrowns . boo ! expensive breakfast , long wait , terrible service , burnt hashbrowns . boo !
just had a shrimp taco delivered by grubhub . i do not think that is the way business should be conducted .
this was easily the worst hotel I have stayed at in the past year . hey yelp  - i want to give these guys zero stars !
i sent this letter to corp headquarters one month ago - never heard back ! bad day for  [redacted ] , or overaggressive corporate attempts to churn business ?
no , no , no do not make the mistake .
this place gets one star for the decor . it has oxygen inside .and seats . this place was so lame i re -downloaded yelp to write this review .
called and received a time within two weeks . pretty good for a dermatology office . i have found another doctor that charges about half of this insane price .
very dirty not clean at all  , no air , one server . food was very dirty not clean at all  , no air , one server . food was
this place is the reason i will avoid the waterfront for good . save the aggravation .

i ate there last night and was completely underwhelmed . i could have gotten better italian food at olive garden and it would have been a lot cheaper too .
we went for dinner on saturday at 7 .30pm . disappointing .
i visited this place with a groupon . it is obvious why they needed to put one out will not return
save your money - -do not order from here ! really spend your money elsewhere you shall  / you will be bette off .
where are the wontons , frank ? i will never eat here again .
i rented from a &g in 2013 -14 and they were terrible from the start . i highly recommend not renting from this organization .
for the price ! with tip , we paid roughly 60 $ . absolutely ridiculous !
thank you brennan for your reply have a nice day
i had a bad experience using a groupon with leeba on summer st . stay away from this leeba salon on summer st .
