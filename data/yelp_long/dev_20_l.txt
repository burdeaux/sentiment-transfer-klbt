1 . no music in the store will not last long in the usa when old navy and uniqlo are with better service and quality anyway .
i have to say it was a really despicable experience at disney no less . should not there be an expediter checking what goes out from the kitchen ?
wow ; and i mean wow ! avoid this as much as possible , i would settle for mediocre food at this point over buddahs orient express
i have now tried this place twice through a delivery service called eat24hours .com . i will not be eating from here ever again .
this review is based on a visit on a saturday night for dancing . i am not going back there again .
stay away  - vegetarians and those with allergies ! willys , as a loyal customer for more than a decade , i am disappointed .
the szechuan lamb was unbelievably salty . crab puffs had almost no filling what so ever in it . just about every dish we had was close to inedible .
pretty bland tasteless food , and they charge a bit extra randomly for tax , to sneak an extra dollar or so in . really just not worth it .
strike out across the board . wow . seems like a place with a lot of potential  - just hope they can get their act together .
we had to wait 20 mins to get seated and then got seated almost in the kitchen . wish you guys best of luck
do not order shirts from this place . the whole family has no idea how to treat people . small business owner .
do not waste your time or money on this show . it was slow and boring like some of the comments already mentioned . so disappointing .
entire experience was very stressful and the end result was not worth it . very expensive for a sandwich and will not be returning .
i wish i could give negative stars  . i will not be dining with zpizza again . I had encourage you not to , either .
really sad to see this place go downhill since it first opened in 2017 . down to 1 star . boo
false advertising : rental car is not at the airport . they do not answer the phone , so do not even try to cal
warning  - do not buy houseplants here ! beware ! do not buy their infected plants  - even they will not stand behind their crappy quality !
I had prefer to put 0 stars but it is all good overall the food needs a lot of work and definitely a taste check before serving .
they stop serving breakfast items at 11 :30am , but do not have this posted anywhere . i am done with them .
updated review : these had a good amount of filling . they were a little hard  - maybe slightly overcooked or were not completely fresh ?
in a nut shell , slop from a garbage pit for pigs would have been better . this place will be closed in less than a year .
dirty rooms , poor management , we do not recommend . dirty rooms , poor management , we do not recommend .

i went to lush under the presumption that i was going to get an amazing full set . i was rushed in , meanwhile i was mila .
not great man . got a wrap and a few sides . nothing special about this place whatsoever . thank you .
whoa ! not impressive ! i should have suspected that something was wrong , considering that they do not even have a proper answering message on their phone .
this is probably the worst au bon pain you ever tried . plus they do not clean the place as often as they should .
es not care about being accommodating to guests , and just over all will not be bothered for anything . btw , the phone does not work .
do not get your car serviced here . i went here because my normal mechanic was moving shops . will not make that mistake again .

the joke of an er tried to kill my wife . stay far far away from this place , especially the er !

I am having the exact same issue as the review below me . starting to get roaches at this point . do not waste your time
first of all : an entry fee for a flea market ? rofl . to sum it up : lame .
if you want to stay in squalor and pay top dollar - then this is the place for you . conrad hilton would be ashamed .

pricey and stingy if you like to take photo of food when you eat out like me . you can compare quickly how stingy oga 's rolls are .

im really really shocked . im a big fan of pf . but today it was the worst  : ( even restrooms is ouch
for the love of god do not eat here ! do yourself a favor and avoid this tasteless zoo at all costs .
these guys would have left me high and dry . the room was cute though . too bad about the management .
never . again . they say time heals all wounds . it is certainly the only thing that can heal my hair , now .
terrible food , terrible services . the heavily advertised  $5 lunches are actually  $6 here . never to return . what was i thinking ?
the manager d patel , was very rude and unprofessional . the place is horrible  , what a terrible experience and management .
the  "greek salad " was mostly lettuce , and with a  "chicken breast " came to  $16 and change , i left hungry and angry . hated it .
family health center , i am disappointed . and for me , that says more than enough about whether or not i will ever find my way back here .
I had rather walk through irvington at night waving the confederate flag . I had rather walk through irvington at night waving the confederate flag .
omg ! i have learned my lesson and i will not be returning . i should have left immediately when i saw the  "b " sanitation grade .
the store is dirty . there are too many other corner stores to ever shop here . go somewhere else .
with one exception , very rude and unprofessional staff . will not come back . with one exception , very rude and unprofessional staff . will not come back .
absolutely the worst customer service I have ever experienced ! do not bother to go there .you deserve better customer service .
the only reason why i am giving this place one star is for the semi -polite staff and social distancing . do not waste your money here !
i was thinking about giving it try for the 2nd time in 2018 i was thinking about giving it try for the 2nd time in 2018
I have been here twice . i have been disappointed twice . it is worth a try . but do not say i did not warn you .
terrible job ! 7 months after completion punch list no completed . please stay away from them . they promise you the world and do not keep their word .
horrible ! if you are looking for a good authentic persian food , i strongly suggest you try a different restaurant .
jim 's right . after experiencing better facilities , I am never going back and i would not recommend this place to a friend .
not worth the rate  ( $250 - $300 a night ) do not think i will ever be coming back .
by far the driest pizza ever . service was really bad 1 hour wait for one slice of cheese . never got it ! order dominos instead .
this review is for the location on 9816 n . whittaker rd in portland , oregon 97217  (503 )283 -2413 . christopher c .
this place should actually be shut down . mind you , i came in for kale , which was brown , decayed , and still on the shelves .
first time eating at henri 's as they just opened one in our neighborhood and i must say unimpressed . total disappointment .
i booked a mother 's day buffet brunch for my wife . the only good thing i can day was that the valet parking was included .
waited for food for 2 hours for not even the amount we ordered . save your time and go dine somewhere else !
super  (and i mean really ) loud indoors when it is busy , it is like a school cafeteria . do not bother .
absolutely the worst service I have experienced in the last 5  + years . if i could , i would rate them  -0
fucking terrible kirin and its clientele are pretentious asshats . there are better places to spend your time and money .
super disappointed in how the company is handling covid . maybe think twice about working out here and adhering to the corporate jargon . not customer friendly
one word sums up this experience : disappointment . I am glad i came just so that i know i am not missing anything .
summary : poor service  & no happy hour .  - the only thing i liked about the place is the variety that they had to offer .
$1 ,000 lost by being bank of america customer unfortunately the two year statute of limitations period has expired , and my mistake was not quickly hiring a lawyer .
stay away awful service . if you do not like your job then find another . bartender is unfriendly  (k )
i never leave reviews but i had to for this place . i does not even deserve a single star . do not stay here !
ava is literally one of the worst restaurants i believe that i have ever eaten at . overall , this is not the restaurant to try .
worst place on earth that you can order an arrangement from ! i will never refer anyone to this place or buy anymore flowers from this company
we just wanted a working safe . if this is their mechanism and approach to customer service , I had avoid at all costs .
frontier should change their name to  "fuck you airlines " because that is their brand . no one tells lianne stokes to stay in denver and pay for it .
just a quick update : sorry tisol for the 1 star rating but you should probably train everyone to know the same policy before letting them run their mouths .
the rudest and straight out disrespectful bartenders on friday night . terrible customer service . great lobster salad ! too bad i will not return !
was not expecting this to be nice , but it is down right old and broken down . ihg - time to sell this one off .
the service was fine . the results were not . i did go to them once before a couple years ago , and the results were far better .
one of the worst ramen place in vancouver ! i could eat better in somewhere else with the same price .
we have tried so hard to like you . you are like a selfish bitch that cares nothing but the easy route . you are never again .
went to best buy to buy a product and salesman says sorry you can only buy that online . they will go bankrupt soon anyways .
really do not even want to give 1 star . service is absolutely rude . i go to lorenzo 's mexican restaurant at bellingham .
whoo boy . if this is the sort of food and service that is normal here now , i have no idea how this place is still in business .
as far as sports clubs go , this one is by far the worst , and surprisingly not because of the facility itself . happy training .
this place will always have a little place reserved in my brain as serving the absolute worst tofu scramble i have ever eaten . the worst
wait staff only grudgingly offers lukewarm water . unmemorable food . wait staff only grudgingly offers lukewarm water . unmemorable food .
bland and weird . there is nothing about my lunch that reminded me of thai food . i suspect they survive on the location alone .
horrible , horrible i won `t try it again , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,horrible restaurtant in quincy .
disappointing ! there are other restaurants in mills50 that have attentive service and quality products and good prices , so there is no need for me to return .
do not pay actual money for this crap . cottage inn pizza is so bad that i do not even want it for free .

not impressed at all to say the least . ridiculous layout with weak selections . am i the only one to find their multi -level floor plan extremely unpleasant ?
beware of the tuesday lady ! i have had a very good experience on other days .but avoid tuesdays if you can .
food is not good value for money . 15 $ for breakfast and smoothie is definetely not worthed . in sum , go somewhere else for breakfast /brunch .
waited to be acknowledged . helped or even told to leave . the person behind the counter would not even make eye contact . close it or start over .
nice food , cramped and loud . the food was good but expensive  - if you want to pay these prices , might i suggest a nice steakhouse .
i always want to come here with my family because i have to admit that their food is pretty good . peace !
can i give less than 1 star ? ? ? best or worst extra  $8 to leave when i did . cannot decide now .
update : baytril . saved their lives . also - this was a fun continued harassment several months later . added more screen shots .

breakfast taco is the worst i have ever had and i was born in atx . earl campbell should eat here !
these guys are so bad omg . almost every time they get wrong order . where is the owner ? giving the franchise such a bad name and reputation

the workers will cause your vehicles to have more issues than stated . my phone number is 4045633387 if someone wants more feedback please call me .

failure to launch i entirely hope they will make corrections . it would be a good option in the area .
the absolute worst ! could not have been a worse experience . took an uber and paid hundreds of dollars for my trip !

alotto gelato redefined the meaning of  "hand -crafted coffee " this week . alas i live , but my germaphobia has substantially intensified . who knew that was possible .
this is a long review , but attests to how much of a disaster this experience was . awful , unprofessional and incompetent .
they are not  "for the people " .  & I will definitely make sure to let people know about our experience .
if you went here a few years ago and had a good experience , beware the place has changed drastically . would not go back .
how can a spot with 25 washing machines have 8 of then be out of order ? 33 % ? seriously ? who is running this place ?

what a very strange situation . the space is wonderful with the doors open on a warm hope things turn around !
food was meh at best . circa  $80 for a lunch that the wife could not eat and made the mister frown .

one of the worst haunts I have been to in america . halloween will never die , but this place should .
yick ! tired after a long day , decided to try the only chinese delivery we could find . bad day got a whole lot worse .

if you are looking to work with b &g , learn from my mistake . as it turns out , not having paperwork is where it gets really complicated .
the food was fantastic . the service level and overall customer experience were a disappointment . again , the food was fantastically good .
new costumers be aware ! hope this place does well with their regulars because they obviously do not need new costumers .

highly disappointing . not a spot I will come back to or recommend since the food is gross even by  "fast food " standards
with travelling about 120 + nights a year , i have little expectations anymore for service , especially when I am in the south . avoid this establishment !
weird snootiness at this location which is odd because well . it seems like a store a sweet mom would shop at  . will not be back .
where to start . we are locals and we are excited to try a new place out but our first experience will surly be our last .
being from baltimore , i never expect much from a crabcake in fl . lump crab .should have lumps of crab !
if you have to return or exchange an online order skip this location . organize and clean up this store and train your staff better to assist customers .
this home depot is the worst ! poor management  & non existent customer service . customer service is a thing of the past !
how do i give 0 stars ? ps . guess the kitchen gets my star as the burger was decent enough .
literally no english spoken by our server so i could not even get her to understand that i want cucumber in my avocado roll  . img _0752 .jpg
service here is weak and the food is mediocre at best . overall , my experience made me regret the decision to eat out . that is sad .
this place would have been alright if the food would have been even remotely warm and the wait staff did not move at a snails pace .

nice location but pricey coffee . ordered a medium and it was  $2 .40 . pretty rich . not worth stopping here .
this place sucks . the gym is dark , dingy , and nothing impressive . the trainer i worked with was not certified .
customer service  (at the sandwich bar ) is horrible . i think the staffs do not like student customers in general . food is not bad .

terrible . i never had a yelp account until today when i created it just to write this review because i was so upset after my experience here .
all i can say is this place is going down real fast . last time we will be eating here .
this was my first time at the inn at bay pointe and my last . no amount of ambiance can make up for a restaurant with incompetent waitstaff .
yikes  - what a difference a couple of months makes . stay away . go to maki maki in woburn . much better food and service .
worst restaurant i ever been . very crowded and not clean table . greasy food . not fresh sushi . horrible .
since this place opened , all shiny and new many years ago , I have been an on -and -off again patron . dine at your own risk !
i have only had a massage here and it was not the best ive ever had . to answer your question no i wouldnt go back to heavenly spa
I will die before i use this place again .and then only because we prepaid our funeral expenses . really , upping your commission on misery ? !
the first time food was cold , slow , and not fresh . oysters not fresh . cannot find even one thing i like .
"every customer counts " then why did nobody help after standing at the counter in front of 2 employees ? i saved myself the trouble and walked out .
there is nothing like spending the day with your friends and family at a terrific theme park . I am going back to disney .
not very tasty , old food .  $30 for 2 adults and 1 child with water to drink . very disappointed !
this food is gross and the owner is extremely rude . this food is gross and the owner is extremely rude .
awful experience ! totally unprofessional , unreliable , and dishonest . do yourself a favor and do not rely on pm to move you . or to have insurance .
they sent my tag to a random location . i do not know why or where they got the address . unprofessional .
highly unprofessional failing restaurant . no wonder they have had to change locations 3 times after being shut down for safety  - hygiene issues  ! stop spamming  !

i will never rent from enterprise again . awful customer service , awful business practices , awful location filled with awful employee .
i asked for the beijing spa treatment . i have been there 4 times and would like to continue to be a client , but this was unacceptable .
terrible customer service . they recoomend the wrong product and will not take it back terrible customer service . they recoomend the wrong product and will not take it back
probably better for the events than for the food . the 1 star is for the rose that we ordered , it was pretty good .
do not go here . four out of six of us got severe food poisoning and it ruined the weekend . service was awful as well .
probably should not write review so quickly after a very disappointing meal maybe they just had a bad night , but i wont risk again .
(i really do not care if a celebrity likes this place . ) i do not know how they make enough money to afford their braintree lease .
never rent from here .i did a mistake even after reading so many other such reviews . the shuttle service is better than the rental  !
first , so you do not think I am crazy , the clam chowder was excellent . did i mention the clam chowder ?

horrible experience , the guy cutting my hair seemed like a guy who was cutting hair for the first time . i will not be returning here anytime soon .
by far the worst service i have ever received . i feel sorry for the owner losing business cause of horrible staff .

still manages to under impress . if you can afford something else , go there . if you can 't , enjoy a different slice of life .
do not sign a lease with fourstar total slum lords . stay tf away from four star , unless you can afford getting ripped off every month
